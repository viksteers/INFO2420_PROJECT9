<h3> Review: Sophie's new companion </h3>
<img src="Images/Tributes/BassetHoundSM.jpg" alt="Basset Hound" class="thumbnailright" width  = "200"  height=  "199">
<p>My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that has a prohibition on pets.  
I really wanted to have a small dog that I could take out for walks, but I though it was not possible.  
Then I heard about Rent A Pet and I was excited to give it a try.  </p>
<p>I found a  loveable bassett hound and met her when she was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning. 
 We went through a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time.  
 The great Rent A Pet staff came and picked her up two hours later and I didn't even have to worry about feeding or watering "Sophie". 
 We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, if the weather permits.  
 I know I look forward to getting in my weekly walk in the park and I imagine Sophie likes it as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Bessie Anderson</p>

<h3> <u>Review: Great for Single College Students w/ Room mates!</u> </h3>

<p>I'm a single college guy and live in an apartment with 3 other guys.  I always wanted to have a large breed of dog that would be a companion to take running or play catch with in the park.  
With the help of Rent A Pet, I found Kamaikaze, a German Shephard.  He loves to run in the summer and even cross country ski in the winter.  </p>
<p>The best thing Kazi likes to do is play Frisbee and run through an obstacle course.  I always attract the attention of girls in the park when we go there.  
I even met my fiance, Janice, when she joined Kazi and me in a heated game of keep away.  One day I will have a home where I can have a yard to keep my own dog.  
Until that time, I can still enjoy the companionship of a good dog.  </p>

<p>Thanks to Rent A Pet,</p>

<h3> <u>Review: My time is valuable.. </u></h3>
<p>My business requires me to travel quite a bit.  So it would be hard for me to own a pet of my own.  I would have to constantly find someone to pet sit, or I would have to pay for boarding the pet.  
I also like to surprise and shock my friends with my unusual pets. Rent A Pet is a perfect solution for my lifestyle.  </p>
<p>I have rented a snake, a Saint Bernard, a pot belly pig and an iguana.  I know my nurturing skills are sadly lacking because I cannot even keep a house plant alive.  
I can have fun with exotic pets without having the worry about keeping them healthy and happy.  </p>
<p>Thanks for adding spice to my life.</p>

<p>Michael Pinette,</p>

<h3> <u>Review: Horses are a girls best friend! </u></h3>
<p>As a young girl, I developed a love of horses.  But I grew up in the city and never had the chance to own my own horse.  I was delighted to find Rent A Pet. </p>
<p>They have several horses to choose from for riders of different levels.  They will deliver the horse to the trail where I want to ride. Because I can request the same horse time after time, 
I have become very comfortable with my skills and the abilities of the horse I ride.  
I would never be able to provide room and board for my own animal.</p>
<p>Thanks for making a dream come true,</p>
<p>Melinda Morrison</p>
